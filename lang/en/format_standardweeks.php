<p>This module explores representations of illness and disability in American literature and culture, with a particular emphasis on contemporary illness narratives.
The module follows a thematic framework and is divided into three sections.
The first section (weeks 13-15) has a more historical flavour and considers the legacy of the nineteenth-century freak show, prosthetic bodies in post-war
and contemporary American culture, and key moments in U.S. disability activism. The second section (weeks 16-21) explores the aesthetics and politics of
illness, using as case studies cancer narratives and AIDS representations from the twentieth century. It also focuses on the "medicalization‚Äù of emotions,
statistical panic, and the fear of death as addressed in postmodern fiction and memoirs that consider illness in relation to age (adolescence) and the
environment. The final section (weeks 22-23)  turns to the depiction of doctors and patients in literature and popular culture, cross-cultural perspectives
on health and illness, and the rise of medical humanities as an academic field.</p>';
